While we can easily see through these partitions, it ends up creating a lot of yelling.</p>\n<p>What if there were a disc, about the size of a hockey puck and the thickness of a few coasters… it would come in pairs, be low-powered and Bluetooth enabled. Stick one on one side of the glass, one on the other. It's a microphone and a speaker… boom. At scale, they'd probably be really cheap.</p>\n<p>One extension: allow the disc to also hook up to a wifi router or laptop. Now, you can have a disc at your home office and your colleague can have one too. Tap it to turn it on, and if the other person chooses to unmute, you can have a casual conversation the way we might in the old office-bound days.</p>\n<p>It's pretty easy to imagine creating a simple app that could record and create a transcript of every transaction, which could be useful for bureaucracies and public records.</p>\n<p>Another extension: Integrate it with real-time translation and now the disk allows you to talk to anyone in any language…</p>\n</div>",

		"created_at": "2022-10-06T03:43:23-04:00",
		"body_html": "<p>If you're looking for a neat-looking tie knot that shows the world you mean business, then the Half Windsor Knot is one you need to know. But just how difficult is the Half Windsor knot to tie? And what else do you need to be aware of before attempting this necktie knot? Read on to find out everything you could ever want to know about the Half Windsor tie knot.</p>\n<p>Even though it's one of the most popular tie knots out there, the Half Windsor is often confused with the Full Windsor Knot, otherwise known as the Double Windsor, or simply just the Windsor Knot. This is understandable for a couple of reasons; firstly, the Double Windsor repeats steps 5 and 6 of our tutorial (therefore using double the length of the tie). Secondly, the Windsor knot is called so after the Duke of Windsor, who supposedly favored this method of knotting his neckties–though some sources have suggested he merely tied a four-in-hand knot and favored ties with a thick interlining, resulting in larger knots.</p>",
